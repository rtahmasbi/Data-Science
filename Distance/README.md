# Distances

- Chebyshev distance (x,y) = max_i(|x_i-y_i|)
- Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.
- Manhattan distance=\el_1 norm
- Mahalanobis distance is a measure of the distance between a point P and a distribution D,
- For probability distributions p and q over the same domain X, the Bhattacharyya distance is defined as:
- To define the Hellinger distance in terms of measure theory, let P and Q denote two probability measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to a third probability measure λ. The square of the Hellinger distance between P and Q is defined as the quantity
- Akritean distance or akrdis is a combination of the Euclidean and the Manhattan distance, designed for use in path finding algorithms as the heuristic distance function. The idea is that Euclidean distance has better results in mostly empty areas and Manhattan in more filled areas, so a combination can be created based on the coverage of the area in each scenario.
- Minkowski distance is a metric in a normed vector space which can be considered as a generalization of both the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance.
- p-norm: (sum_i |x_i-y_i|^p)^{1/p}
 For p = 1 we get the taxicab norm, for p = 2 we get the Euclidean norm, and as p approaches  \infty the p-norm approaches the infinity norm or maximum norm.
- Levenshtein distance (Edit Distance) is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
- To express the Damerau–Levenshtein distance between two strings {\displaystyle a} a and {\displaystyle b} b a function {\displaystyle d_{a,b}(i,j)} d_{a,b}(i,j) is defined, whose value is a distance between an {\displaystyle i} i–symbol prefix (initial substring) of string {\displaystyle a} a and a {\displaystyle j} j–symbol prefix of {\displaystyle b} b.
- Kendall tau distance
- Jaro–Winkler distance
